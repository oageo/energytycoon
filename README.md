Energy Tycoon source release 2 - README
===============================================================================

To compile Energy Tycoon you will need the following development libraries:

 - boost library (Version 1.38 or higher)
     [http://www.boost.org/]

 - tinyxml library (Any version)
     [http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/]

 - OGRE graphics engine (Version 1.6.4 or higher)
     [http://www.ogre3d.org/]

 - irrKlang audio engine (Version 1.2.0 or higher)
     [http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/index.html]

 - OIS input library (Version 1.2.0 or higher)
     [http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois/]

 - MyGUI gui library (Version 2.2.2 with modifications, INCLUDED)
     [http://www.mygui.info/]

 - Editable Terrain library (SVN revision 51 with modifications, INCLUDED)
     [No longer available]

Get the development packages preferably from your distribution or if your
distribution doesn't offer them, download them from the URLs given above and
install them.

The data files, available on Sourceforge from
  [http://sourceforge.net/projects/energytycoon/]
should be installed into "/usr/share/games/energytycoon/". Also the irrKlang
shared object file should be placed either there or in "/usr/local/lib/".

The binary can be installed wherever it suits you best, e.g. "/usr/games/"

If any problems should arise, feel free to contact me:
  [support@energietycoon.de]

PS: I'm working on a "proper" source release, until it's done you have to do
some work yourself to get it running ;). In case you've missed it: There is a
binary Linux package (.deb) available on Sourceforge.
